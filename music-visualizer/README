Music Visualizer
Welcome to the Music Visualizer App! This web app allows users to visualize music in different forms—bars, ripples, or waves—based on an audio file input. The visualization dynamically reacts to the audio played.

Features
File Input: Allows users to select an audio file (in any format) from their local storage.
Play/Stop: You can start or stop the audio playback.
Visualizer Type: Choose between three types of visualizations:
Bars: Frequency data is visualized as bars.
Ripples: Frequency data creates ripple effects in the center.
Waves: Frequency data creates waveform-like visuals.
Canvas: The visualization is rendered on an HTML5 canvas that updates in real time.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structure and layout.
Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern styling.
JavaScript: For handling audio playback, processing frequency data, and rendering visualizations.
Web Audio API: For real-time audio analysis.
HTML5 Canvas: For drawing and rendering the visualizations.

How to Use
Select an Audio File: Choose an audio file (mp3, wav, etc.) by clicking on the file input button.
Choose a Visualization Type: Select from the available visualizer types (Bars, Ripples, or Waves) from the dropdown.
Click Play: Start the audio playback and the visualization will begin.
Click Stop: Stop the audio and clear the visualization from the canvas.
